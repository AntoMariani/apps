 straight to it. Okay, so the basic premise of the game is that you have two teams that each have nine players and whoever scores the most runs wins. So runs are like points. How is it set up? Well the defense plays out in the field and they are situated in the field like so. Now they can move around a little bit but this is basically where they stand. You have your outfielders in the outfield, left field center field.
